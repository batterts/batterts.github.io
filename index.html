        <h1>JQ</h1>
        <p>I use jq on a daily basis to query, parse and transform data.</p>

        <h1></h1>

        Let's look at some open data sources to find out some interesting facts.
        <p>
          <pre>curl -s  https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json|jq -c '.[]|.bio|{ "year":.birthday[0:4], "gender": .gender}'

{"year":"1952","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1958","gender":"F"}
{"year":"1943","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1947","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1960","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1960","gender":"F"}
{"year":"1954","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1941","gender":"M"}
{"year":"1950","gender":"F"}
{"year":"1956","gender":"M"}
          ...</pre>
          </p>

Now we can group by year and get a count for each.  It took me a long time to get group_by() working because I didn't really understand it.  Okay, I still don't completely understand it.
        

<pre>curl -s https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json|jq -c 'group_by(.bio.birthday[0:4]) | map({year: .[0].bio.birthday[0:4], count: (length)})'

Let's sort the list using jq and then we'll print it out in table format.  <a href="https://blog.kellybrazil.com/2020/03/09/json-tables-in-the-terminal/">jtbl</a> is a useful utility. 
        
        <pre>curl -s  https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json|jq -c 'sort_by(.bio.gender+.bio.birthday[0:4]+.terms[0].state)|  .[]|{born:.bio.birthday[0:4], name: (.name.last +", "+ .name.first), state:.terms[0].state, gender:.bio.gender}'|jtbl
